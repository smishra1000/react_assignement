/*Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks can occur in React applications when user input is not properly sanitized or escaped before rendering on the page. Here's an example of how an XSS attack can be executed in a React application:

Suppose you have a React component that renders a user's name inputted through a form:
*/

import React from 'react';

const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;

//Assuming the name prop is rendered without any sanitization or validation, an attacker could enter malicious JavaScript code as their name:
import React from 'react';

const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
When the component is rendered with the following prop value:
<Greeting name="<script>alert('XSS Attack!')</script>"/>
//  The resulting HTML rendered on the page would be:

<h1>Hello, <script>alert('XSS Attack!')</script>!</h1>

  /* As a result, the malicious JavaScript code would be executed in the context of the user's browser, triggering the alert popup. This is a typical example of a reflected XSS attack, where the injected script is directly reflected back to the user.

To mitigate XSS attacks, it's important to properly sanitize and validate any user-generated content before rendering it on 
the page. React provides built-in mechanisms to prevent XSS attacks, such as using JSX expressions instead of string concatenation to 
render dynamic content, which automatically escapes special characters. Additionally, libraries like DOMPurify can be used to sanitize 
user input and prevent script injection. It's crucial to implement these security measures to protect your application and its users from potential vulnerabilities.
